# pgSQLv6-testing
Test PostgreSQL replication and repmgr/barman in IPv6 *only* networks

This is only a quick'n'DIRTY playbook to spool up a PLAYGROUND quickly.
Do not use this in any persistent environment and expect it all runs
smoothly. 

At any point there might be kludgy configuration assumptions.

Main objective is to test the network capabilities in IPv6 here.
